Ep3 card text corrections (from THG Discord):
- AP Absorption: Does not block Tech attacks, instead they deal 2 extra damage.
- Assault: Adds 5 AP minus the number of FCs on your field, not in your deck.
- Assist Return: If this replaces an Assist card that was not in its owner's own Assist slot, that card gets re-played in to that slot.
- Barble: His "Unfilial" ability does 3 damage, not 1.
- Berdysh: Equip requirements are Hunter and Humanoid, not either one.
- Black King Bar: "Machine Influence" doesn't need the opponent to be an attacker.
- Blade Dance: "Insanity" doesn't exist. Has "Steady Damage".
- Combo/Explosion: Adds +(# of Combo cards played in phase squared) AP, but the effect only applies once per attacker.
